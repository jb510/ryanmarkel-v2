# HTTPS All the Things!

A very simple plugin for WordPress that rewrites everything it can to use HTTPS for local resources because the core engine doesn't. :)

Will fill this out shortly, but this code was mostly written by John Blackbourn. I'm just appropriating it and making it a public plugin because I'm pretty sure people can use it.
